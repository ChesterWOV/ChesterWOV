👋 Hi, I’m [@ChesterWOV](https://github.com/ChesterWOV)!
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and playing Chess.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about packaging in Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects about the Shakespeare Programming Language! I recently had a newfound interest in esoteric programming languages :)
- 📫 You can reach me by sending an email to chesterwov@gmail.com or contacting me on Discord. My username is `chesterwov`!

Feel free to contact me if you have issues on packages I make!

Also... I actually have another account: [@ChesterWOV-DPY](https://github.com/ChesterWOV-DPY).
I, for some reason, couldn't claim the `@ChesterWOV` username when I created that account... but now, again, for some reason, can claim it now... so I will be switching to this account! I still have my repositories in my old account though, so feel free to check it out!
